# June 22th: Brainstorming and part listing

Today I started working on my laser gun project. This is my first project on highway and i think it's turning out well.
During the little time that i had today i started searching all the Materials that i would need for the project and i created the project list.
In two days i will start making the 3d part of my project.

**Total time spent: 1.5h**
