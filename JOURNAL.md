## June 22th: Brainstorming and part listing

Today I started working on my laser gun project. This is my first project on highway and i think it's turning out well.
During the little time that i had today i started searching all the Materials that i would need for the project and i created the project list.
In two days i will start making the 3d part of my project.

**Total time spent: 1.5h**

## June 23th: README.md and Sketch

Today i spent some time on the desing of my diy laser tag gun and i decided to go with a design between reality and sci-fi and i think that my sketch turned out preety good i think that if i have some more time today i will start the 3d modelling.
